Summary of important user-visible changes for version 6 (yyyy-mm-dd):
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The graphics backend has seen many small improvements. 
    
    * Graphic primitives now accept a color property value of "none"
      which is useful when a particular primitive needs to be hidden
      (for example, the Y-axis of an axes object with "ycolor" = "none")
      without hiding the entire primitive ("visibility" = "off").

    * "LineWidth" and "MarkerSize" properties are now measured in
      points, *not* pixels.  This change was made for Matlab
      compatibility.  Compared to previous versions of Octave, some
      lines and markers will appear 4/3 larger.

    * The appearance of patterned lines (LineStyle = ":"|"--"|"-.") has
      been improved for small widths (LineWidth < 1.5 pixels) which is a
      common scenario.

 ** New functions added in Octave 6:

      lightangle
      verLessThan

 ** Deprecated functions.

    The following functions have been deprecated in Octave 6 and will
    be removed from Octave 8 (or whatever version is the second major
