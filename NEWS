Summary of important user-visible changes for version 5.0 (yyyy-mm-dd):
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The functions issymmetric and ishermitian accept an option "nonskew"
    or "skew" to calculate the symmetric or skew-symmetric property
    of a matrix.  Performance has also been increased.

 ** The issorted function now uses a direction option of "ascend" or
    "descend" to make it compatible with both the sort function and
    with Matlab.  Change all uses of "ascending" and "descending" in
    existing code to the new options.

 ** The strncmp and strncmpi functions now return true if the two input
    strings match, even though the number of characters specified by N
    exceeds the string length.  This behavior more closely matches
    common sense and is Matlab compatible.  Example:

      Octave 5.0 : strncmp ("abc", "abc", 100) => true
      Previously : strncmp ("abc", "abc", 100) => false

 ** Figure graphic objects have a new property "Number" which is
    read-only and will return the handle (number) of the figure.
    However, if the property "IntegerHandle" has been set to "off" then
    the property will return an empty matrix ([]).

 ** Printing using the -dtiff output device will now create compressed
    images using lzw compression.  This change was made for Matlab
    compatibility.  To produce uncompressed images use the -dtiffn
    device.

 ** The FFTW library is now required to perform FFT calculations.  The
    FFTPACK sources have been removed from Octave.

 ** The OSMesa library is no longer used.  To print invisible figures
    when using OpenGL graphics, the Qt QOFFSCREENSURFACE feature must be
    available and you must use the qt graphics toolkit.

 ** Deprecated functions.

    The following functions have been deprecated in Octave 5.0 and will
    be removed from Octave 7 (or whatever version is the second major
    release after 5.0):

      Function             | Replacement
      ---------------------|------------------
                           |

    deprecated in Octave 5.0 and will be removed from Octave 7 (or whatever
    version is the second major release after 5.0):

    deprecated in Octave 4.2 and have been removed from Octave 5.0:

      Object               | Property                | Value
      ---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------
      axes                 | xaxislocation           | "zero"
