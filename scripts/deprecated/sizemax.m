## @code{sizemax} is deprecated and will be removed in Octave version 8.
##
## Return the largest value allowed for the size of an array.
## 
## If Octave is compiled with 64-bit indexing, the result is of class int64,
## otherwise it is of class int32.  The maximum array size is slightly smaller
## than the maximum value allowable for the relevant class as reported by
## @code{intmax}.
